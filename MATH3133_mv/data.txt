Daily data from 1990-2009 extracted at 146.72 deg E, 36.571 deg S, being the
streamflow gauge location of catchment 403210, Ovens River @ Myrtleford.

(Most) variable names and units are given in:
https://is-enes-data.github.io/CORDEX_variables_requirement_table.pdf

The target variable (rainfall/precipitation) is "pr", which is given in units
of kg.m^{-2}.s^{-1} (to convert to mm/day, multiply by 86400).

Some variables may not appear in the CORDEX variables list, in particular the
upper case variables (e.g. CAPE) which looks like it is a WRF (RCM) internal
variable, rather than a GCM variable.

Data was extracted via CDO remapnn function (nearest-neighbour mapping):
